Description: Implementation of various statistical functions of RStudio in Scilab.
 - RStudio functions can be called from Scilab,
 - Requires installation of R and Scilab.
 - Initialising R environment in terminal in linux using "sudo apt-get install r-base" and using "export R_HOME = /usr/lib/R"
 - Launching Scilab by calling "./scilab"
 - Running ./run.sh file
 - Executing the command 'exec builder.sce' in scilab console inside the     toolbox directory
 - Executing the command 'exec loader.sce' in scilab console inside the     toolbox directory
 - Calling RStudio methods by declaring it to a variable. For example     declaring as: a = kruskal_wallis() method, declaring as: a =     kruskal_wallis()
